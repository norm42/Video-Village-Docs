# FAQ
Work in progress - questions that I (norm86) or authors might ask.   ?? separate areas that need review/input.
## User/Artist Centric
##### What is the video resolution?
The video is played at 800Hx600V.  We will convert videos that are submitted to this resolution automatically.  However, it is best if your videos are at this resolution to insure that your content appears as you intended.  ??will we keep the aspect ratio of the original video??
##### Can I play videos on multiple projectors?
Yes.  You can schedule your videos on multiple projectors.  You must select the content for each projector and include that in the schedule.
##### Are video's synchronized  when played on multiple projectors?
Videos are synchronized to ??seconds - we need to test this out to see what is practical??
##### Can I also play audio with the video?
No.  You can include audio in the video file but it will not be played.  We allow multiple authors videos to be playing at once, that makes audio impractical.
##### How long can my videos be?
We play videos from ?? to ??.  Your videos can span the full time period.  ??I do not think there is an issue with file size as even dvd quality is ~2GB/hour.??
##### What file formats are supported?
We support ??MP4 H.264...others??
##### Will I get confirmation that my videos and schedule are accepted to play?
??I assume we will send some email indicating the success of the uploads/schedule.  And that the schedule will be visible on a web page??
##### What bit rate should I use?
We recommend a rate no greater than ??XXXX bits/second - these are typical selections on video creation software??
##### What frame rate should I use?
??We will play up to 29 frames/second  OR should we recommend a frame rate or a list of rates that the player will support??
##### Can I specify the locations my videos will play?
Yes.  In the schedule, you can indicate which locations for your videos to play.  ??we may want a mode that is "anywhere" or "required".  The "required" mode may conflict with other videos that are playing that night.  We need a way to give feedback and manage conflicts??
##### Is there a site where the audience can give feedback on the videos?
??Do we want to have a forum or site for feedback to the author and/or just comments on the videos??
##### Can I play a sequence of still images?
No.  You would need to put the images in a video file to play.  ??most video tools support this and we could have lots of files for still images - like family vacation pics.  Might be painful to upload... OR we could allow this??
##### How long are the videos kept when I upload them?
??Management of content on the server.  When do we purge, can the author submit a new schedule using previously loaded content??



## Workflow Centric
##### Projector location
We need to provide a location diagram for the projectors that maps to the schedule.
##### Are we providing an editor/tool to create playlists?
Playlists could be hard for someone to generate on their own.  In particular if there are multiple videos/locations as part of the content. 
##### File size/upload limits
While there are likely no space limits, there maybe issues with up/down load times.  The user may have only a few Mbits upload, download is likely faster.  We may want to put some quidelines on bandwidth/time.
##### Scheduler Capabilties
Need to provide what capabilities exist for scheduler.  {start time, stop time, etc}.
##### Content location for upload.
??Are we only allowing a user to upload from local storage??
